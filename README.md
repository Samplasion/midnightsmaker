# Midnights Maker

**Author's note:**  
I would not call this the best example of my work. I wasn't expecting to open-source it, and took some ugly shortcuts at times. For example, some sections could be de-duplicated or simplified, or constants could be moved into a variable and reused instead. If I was doing it properly, I would probably also have multiple components instead of doing everything in `app.vue`.

Regardless, I hope you find some of this useful, or interesting. Enjoy!
